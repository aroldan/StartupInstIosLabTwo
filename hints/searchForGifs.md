# Search the [Giphy API](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI) for GIFs that match search terms.

## Things to think about

What API endpoint do we need to hit in order to search?

How do the results come back?

Which ViewController should be responsible for the query?

How can I convert the results of the query into model objects?

Once you have the model objects, implement the UITableViewDataSource delegate methods.
